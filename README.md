## Enable easy ML model deployment using tools of your own preference with ONNX

Over the years, data scientists and engineers have worked on great tools to build and generate useful machine learning models across different industries. Open Neural Network Exchange is an open ecosystem which empowers data scientists and engineers to collaborate. With ONNX, we are able to export our machine learning models to a standard format so it can be deployed and used by other applications. In the talk, I will show you what is ONNX and how we can leverage it to deploy our ML models to different apps including frontend web app as well as backend server app.
